Joseph: the script will have to parse about 5000 XMLs
they are located in folders like this: authors/book1/*.xml
author2/book5/*.xml
etc
so function 1 is a folder listing method..
you could also use find . -name "*.xml", but it'd be nicer in python
function 2 is to parse the XML (i'll send it to you now) and produce a word document with the library: python-doc

[11:00:29] Joseph: the word document should be placed in a folder called: output/author - year - book_title
yeah sure
the XML is pretty clean and should be ok
